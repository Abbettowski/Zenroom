Scenario simple: Encrypt a message with the password
Given nothing # no input is given to this contract
When I write 'my secret word' in 'password'
and I write 'a very short but very confidential message' in 'whisper'
and I write 'for your eyes only' in 'header'
and I encrypt the secret message 'whisper' with 'password'
Then print the 'secret message'
