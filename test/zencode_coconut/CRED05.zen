Scenario 'coconut': "To run by the credential issuer and store the output as ci_signed_credential.json"
Given that I am known as 'issuer_identifier'
and I have my valid 'issuer keypair'
and I have a valid 'credential signature request'
When I sign the credential
Then print the 'credential'
and print the 'ca verify'
