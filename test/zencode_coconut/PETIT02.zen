Scenario 'coconut': "Approve the creation of a petition: executed by a Citizen, using several keys"
Given that I have a valid 'ca verify' from 'issuer_identifier'
and I have a valid 'credential proof'
and I have a valid 'petition'
When I aggregate all 'ca verify'
and I verify the credential proof is correct
and I verify the new petition to be empty
Then print the 'petition'
and print the 'verifiers'
