Scenario 'coconut': "To run by citizen and send the result blindproof_credential.json to the verifier/checker"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential keypair'
and I have a valid 'ca_verify' from 'issuer identifier'
and I have my valid 'credentials'
When I aggregate all 'ca verify'
# TODO: ca_verify -> verification key
and I create a credential proof
Then print the 'credential proof'
