Scenario 'coconut': "Citizen creates a new petition, using his own key, the credential and the credential issuer's public"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my valid 'credential keypair'
and I have my valid 'credentials'
and I have a valid 'ca verify' from 'issuer_identifier'
When I aggregate all 'ca verify'
and I create a credential proof
and I create a petition 'poll'
Then print all data
