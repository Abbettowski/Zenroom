# Encrypt with password
Scenario 'ecdh': Encrypt a message with the password
# the names "header", "message" and "password" are hardcoded when using the encrypt statement
Given I have a 'string' named 'password'
And I have a 'string' named 'message'
And I have a 'string' named 'header'
When I encrypt the secret message 'message' with 'password'
# anything introduced by 'the' becomes a new variable
Then print the 'secret message'
