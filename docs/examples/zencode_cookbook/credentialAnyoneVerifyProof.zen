Scenario credential: verify proof
    Given that I have a valid 'verifier' inside 'MadHatter'
    and I have a valid 'credential proof'
    When I aggregate the verifiers
    When I verify the credential proof
    Then print 'The proof matches the verifier! So you can add zencode after the verify statement, that will execute only if the match occurs.'
