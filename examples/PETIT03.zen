Scenario 'coconut': "Sign petition: the Citizen signs the petition, with his own keys, aggregating it with the credential and with the Credential Issuer public key"
Given I am 'Alice'
and I have my valid 'credential keypair'
and I have a valid 'credentials'
and I have a valid 'ca verify' from 'MadHatter'
When I aggregate all 'ca verify'
and I create a petition signature 'poll'
Then print the 'petition signature'
