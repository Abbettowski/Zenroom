# List of planned improvements

This is a draft TODO list for future directions in zenroom
development, to be vouched with priorities emerging from DECODE pilots
and their specific use-cases.

-faddress-sanitizers <- (check flags)

elements in multiplications that take ECP* and BIG should be checked
for position, for instance ECP multiplication needs to have the BIG
number always as second argument. Instead of returning error we should
check the type and reposition the arguments accordingly.


## Review

IV fine - if key is always different IV is not needed
for reusal of the key then IV needs to be random (or a counter)


RNG -> fortuna

ECDH keylen 16<k>64

ecdh_aead_encrypt limit key size to 32 bytes (256 bit)
accepted values to aes: 128 192 256



https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/blob/master/lib/milagro-crypto-c/src/ecdh.c.in#L71

co-factor of a curve
instead of checking always if point is part of curve
multiple of co-factors 


## Low-hanging

- memory locking with controls at switch Given (r/o) -> When (r/w) -> Then (w/o)
- variable wiping with content overwriting in GC
- DATA and KEYS wiping in Zencode
X adopt finite state machine in Zencode parser
- wipe previous memory block in Zencode
X load multiple scenarios, build `documentation` scenario with ZEN.callback

## Benchmarking

extend redroom for in-memory benchmarks

prime number discovery using crypto primitives:
https://github.com/pakozm/lua-happy-prime-numbers/blob/master/happy_primes.lua

using perf-tool:
```
perf record zenroom $*
perf report
```

### Optimizations

Take DATA inside Zencode without parsing from JSON
- fast detect if JSON: `[` or `{` as first char
- fast detect of type by 3 char prefix: `u64:` or `b64:`
X read into IN with name of prefix (data schema)
X insure that parsing to ACK implies only one memcpy to octet

## Deterministic Random in the Checker

take an external rng buffer filled with random by the caller

provide zencode with random from this pool and move the index forward

return an error when the random is exhausted and more is needed


## Coconut notes

useful to have a functio that does PAIR:ate and PAIR:fexp on the same ECP2
also ate() can be called miller_loop and miller() and loop()
FP12 = pair(ECP1, ECP2)
then FP12 equals is the only thing needed


```
require'ecp'
mypoint = ecp.hash_to_point(octet)
mynewbig = big.hash_to_big(13123,123123213,2334)
mypoint = ecp.hash(octet)
mynewbig = big.hash(1213123213,1221232141,123213324)
!! hash_to_big has variadic arguments !!

```
hash_to_point:
function that takes any octet string
hashes it with any hashing algorithm
does a mapit to place it on the curve

hash_to_big:
very useful to have
a hash function that takes a series of big numbers
and outputs a big number
the big number series can be simply concatenated
and then hashed as a series of bytes


expose G1 as fixed ECP point
expose G2 as fixed ECP2 point
i.e.
/* Generator point on G1 */
extern const BIG_384_29 CURVE_Gx_BLS383; /**< x-coordinate of generator point in group G1  */
extern const BIG_384_29 CURVE_Gy_BLS383; /**< y-coordinate of generator point in group G1  */
should become a const ECP 

about DBIG: no need to expose
they result from big multiplications between big numbers
but there is never a real use, because all useful multiplications have a modulus applied

every FP is also a BIG
but not every BIG is also an FP
exporting in BIG is more interesting since it can be of any size
and can be reduced to FP to match the curve

each curve has a different infinity point

TODO: do all ecp2 (new namespace)

TODO: pair.h 
extern void PAIR_ZZZ_fexp(FP12_YYY *x);
extern void PAIR_ZZZ_ate(FP12_YYY *r,ECP2_ZZZ *P,ECP_ZZZ *Q);
possibly extern int PAIR_ZZZ_GTmember(FP12_YYY *x);
!!!!
FP12_YYY is exactly twice as big of the FP1 of the curve
so its made of two BIGs and can be a tuple

TODO: big numbers operations
	in particular BIG_XXX_mod*

DONE:
infinity production for "EC generator"
test:
O = infinity point
P + O = P
(-P) + P = O
DONE:
to expose the order of the curve:
like in rom_curve_XXX:
const BIG_256_29 CURVE_Order_ED25519= {0x1CF5D3ED,0x9318D2,0x1DE73596,0x1DF3BD45,0x14D,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x100000};
test:
multiply group order by the generetor should give the point at infinity
