# Zenroom - DECODE project

[![software by Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/software_by_dyne.png)](http://www.dyne.org)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DECODEproject/zenroom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DECODEproject/zenroom)

**Restricted execution environment** for cryptographic operations in a **Turing-incomplete language** based on LUA syntax and coarse-grained control of number of operations and memory used.

Zenroom follows a minimal design with security and portability in mind: it can be used in **untrusted distributed computing**, for instance in distributed ledger or **blockchain smart contracts**.

Zenroom compiles to fully **static native binaries** for embedded use, but also to **javascript** for client-side use for instance in **mobile applications**.

With Zenroom is easy to write **portable** software using **end-to-end encryption** using various classic and advanced cryptographic primitives to manage asymmetric keys, key derivation, hashing and signing functionalities.

This README documentation is operational. For more information on the purpose and design of this software see:

This project is receiving funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement nr. 732546 (DECODE).

## Build instructions

Pre-built binaries are available here https://sdk.dyne.org:4443/view/decode/ - this section is optional for those who want to build this software from source. The following build instructions contain generic information meant for an expert audience.

The Zenroom compiles the same sourcecode to run on Linux in the form of 2 different POSIX compatible ELF binary formats using GCC (linking shared libraries) or musl-libc (fully static) targeting both X86 and ARM architectures. It also compiles to a Windows 64-bit native and fully static executable. At last, it compiles to Javascript/Webassembly using the LLVM based emscripten SDK. To recapitulate some Makefile targets:

1. `make shared` its the simpliest, builds a shared executable linked to a system-wide libc, libm and libpthread (mostly for debugging)
2. `make static` builds a fully static executable linked to musl-libc (to be operated on embedded platforms)
3. `make js` or `make wasm` builds different flavors of Javascript modules to be operated from a browser or NodeJS (for client side operations)
4. `make win` builds a Windows 64bit executable with no DLL dependancy, containing the LUA interpreter and all crypto functions (for client side operations on windows desktops)

Remember that if after cloning this source code from git, one should do:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then first build the shared executable environment:

```
make shared
```
To run tests:

```
make check-shared
```

To build the static environment:

```
make bootstrap
make static
make check-static
```

For the Javascript and WebAssembly modules the Zenroom provides various targets provided by emscripten which must be installed and loaded in the environment according to the emsdk's instructions :

```
make js
make wasm
make html
```

## Crypto functionalities

The Zenroom language interpreter includes statically the following cryptographic primitives:

- **Norx** authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) - this is the default 64-4-1 variant (256-bit key and nonce, 4 rounds)
- **Blake2b** cryptographic hash function
- **Argon2i**, a modern key derivation function based on Blake2. Like 
scrypt, it is designed to be expensive in both CPU and memory.
- **Curve25519**-based key exchange and public key encryption,
- **Ed25519**-based signature function using Blake2b hash instead of sha512,

Legacy cryptographic functions include **md5**, and **rc4**.

Endoding and decoding functions are provided for **base64** and **base58** (for base58, the BitCoin encoding alphabet is used).

Compression functions based on **BriefLZ** are also included.

Inclusion of classic NIST compliant **RSA** and **DSA** algorithms is in progress.

## Operating instructions

This software is work in progress and this section will be extended in the near future. Scripts found in the test/ directory provide good examples to start from.

From **command-line** the Zenroom is operated passing files as arguments:

```
Usage: zenroom [-c config] [-a arguments] script.lua
```

From **javascript** the function `zenroom_exec()` is exposed with four arguments: three strings and one number from 1 to 3 indicating the verbosity of output on the console:

```
int zenroom_exec(char *script, char *config, char *arguments, int verbosity)
```

The contents of the three strings cannot exceed 100k in size and are of different types:

- `script` is a parsable LUA script, for example:
```lua
t = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pk, sk = keygen_sign_ed25519() -- signature keypair
sig = sign_ed25519(sk, pk, t)
assert(#sig == 64)
assert(check_ed25519(sig, pk, t))
```

- `config` is also a parsable LUA script declaring variables, for example:
```lua
memory_limit = 100000
instruction_limit = 696969
output_limit = 64*1024
log_level = 7
remove_entries = {
	[''] = {'dofile','load', 'loadfile','newproxy'},
	os = {'getenv','execute','exit','remove','rename',
		  'setlocale','tmpname'},
    math = {'random', 'randomseed'}
 }
disable_modules = {io = 1}
```

- `arguments` is a simple json, flat to the 1st level, declaring key/value pair strings, for example:
```json
{
	"secret": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
	"salt":   "TKIpxzSJ1enTbnei",
	"key":    "my symmetric password someone will guess one day"
}
```
All strings parsed in the arguments files will be available as pre-declared global variables to the script.
