Zenroom is software in **ALPHA stage** and is part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). This software aims to make it easy and less error-prone to write **portable** scripts using **end-to-end encryption** inside isolated environments that can be easily made **interoperable**. Basic crypto functions provided include primitives to manage **a/symmetric keys, key derivation, hashing and signing functionalities**. The [API documentation](https://zenroom.dyne.org/api) is a work in progress subject to slight changes.

Zenroom's **restricted execution environment** is a sort of [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28computer_security%29) that executes cryptographic operations in a **Turing-incomplete language** without any access to the calling process, underlying operating system or filesystem. Zenroom's parser is based on LUA's [syntax-direct translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax-directed_translation) engine, has coarse-grained control of computations and memory.

Zenroom is software inspired by [langsec.org](language-theoretical security) and it is designed to brittle and exit execution returning a meaningful error on any error occurred. Zenroom's documentation and examples are being written to encourage a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) approach to scripting, treating even complex data structures as [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen).

The main use case for Zenroom is that of **distributed computing** of untrusted code where advanced cryptographic functions are required, for instance it can be used as a distributed ledger implementation (also known as **blockchain smart contracts**).

For a larger picture describing the purpose and design of this software in the field of **data-ownership** and **secure distributed computing**, see:
