![Zenroom logo](https://dev.zenroom.org/img/zenroom_logo-sm.jpg)

Zenroom is a **secure language interpreter** of both Lua and its own
Zencode language to execute fast cryptographic operations using
elliptic curve arithmetics.

The Zenroom VM is very small, has **no external dependency**, is fully
deterministic and ready to run **end-to-end encryption** on any platform:
desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud and even web browsers.

**Zencode** is the name of the language executed by Zenroom: it is simple
to understand and can process large data structures while operating
cryptographic transformations on them.
